/*
Regular expression (or RegEx)
A regular expression is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. It is mainly used for string pattern matching.
Regular expressions are extremely useful in extracting information from text such as: code, log files, spreadsheets, documents, etc.
We can match a specific string  in a test string  by making our regex pattern . This is one of the simplest patterns. However, in the 
coming challenges, we'll see how well we can match more complex patterns and learn about their syntax.

Task
You have a test string . Your task is to match the string hackerrank. This is case sensitive.

Note
This is a regex only challenge. You are not required to write code.
You only have to fill in the regex pattern in the blank (_________).
